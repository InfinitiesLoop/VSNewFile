A simple Visual Studio addin that makes it possible to add new items to a project or project folder without going through the "Add New" dialog by adding menu items such as "Add New Script" directly to the context menu.
Supports customizing the available templates, their order in the menu, and the icons they use, with a simple file-based mechanism.
